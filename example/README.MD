This example shows how to use `redux-discord-middleware` to manage a state of the client and to reply on messages.

To run this example install dependencies with Yarn / NPM.
Also you need to set the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable to your bot token.
For this you can change start script or supply your token in your env.

You can then start the script using `yarn start` or `npm run start` OR by running `node ./index.js`.

When the script is running, connect with redux remote development tools to see emitted actions.
